# Carbon Emission Calculator

## Overview
This is a simple SQL project that demonstrates how to create a basic carbon emission calculator using a MySQL database. The project includes SQL scripts to create a database table for storing emission data, insert sample data into the table, and calculate total emissions for a specific date range.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

carbon_emission.sql: SQL script containing the database schema and sample data for the emissions table.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started
To use the Carbon Emission Calculator:

- Database Setup: You will need a MySQL database server. If you don't have MySQL installed, you can download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions.
- Database Initialization: Execute the carbon_emission.sql script in your MySQL database to create the necessary table and insert sample data. You can use MySQL Workbench, the MySQL command-line client, or any other MySQL management tool to execute the script.
- Running Queries: Once the database is set up, you can run SQL queries to interact with the emissions data. For example, you can calculate the total emissions for a specific date range using the provided sample query in the carbon_emission.sql file.
